## Overview

"Echoes of Silence" is an immersive iOS app crafted for the [Swift Student Challenge 2025](https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/), weaving music, history, and technology into a transformative journey. Guided by Ludwig van Beethoven, players explore a piano in augmented reality, master *Für Elise*, and perform it on the grand Steve Jobs Theater stage—experiencing the fading sound of Beethoven’s deafness. This app celebrates resilience, ignites a passion for music, and fosters empathy for the deaf community.
